# Session Notes

## Session 1
Met Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter in Neverwinter, agreed to deliver
their cart of goods to Phandalin for 10gp each.
Each character was granted a healing potion.

On their way they came across an ambush site, where they defeated 4 goblins,
one of which they interrogated.  From the goblin they learned about Klarg the
bugbear, King Grol, and the Black Spider.  They also learned that Gundren
Rockerseeker and his companion, Sildar Hallwinter, are still alive.  Sildar
was taken to Cragmaw Hideout, and Gundren was taken to Cragmaw Castle.

The team headed to the trading post in Plandalin to deliver their cart and to
rest before attempting to rescue anyone.  The owner of the trading post, Elmar
Barthen, paid them their 10gp.  He also rounded up money from some locals as
a reward if they would clear the cave and rescue anyone inside.

They rested at the inn for the night.

### Notes
Killed 4 goblins
Found empty map case

## Session 2
Party meets in the dining area of the inn.  After a short discussion they head
out to resupply before heading to Cragmaw Hideout.  From the trading post they
acquire some rope, torches, a bullseye lantern and a grappling hook.

They head back to the scene of the ambush to pick up the trail.  Outside of the
hideout Drupie missed the 2 goblin sentries, however they were quickly felled.

Once inside they found a room that held three wolves, Dilford was able to calm
them with his animal handling.  They then each climbed up the fissure at the
back of the room and found themselves in Klargs room.  Klarg, his wolf and his
2 goblins did not see them.  Senor Bucket was able to sleep the wolf and two
goblins, and more importantly charm Klarg.  They promised to go ambushing with
Klar, he just needed to meet them outside.  One Klarg left they were able to
kill off the sleeping enemies.

The party regroup with Klarg and learned where Sildar was held, and that he was
soon to be eaten.  They also learned the Gundren is still currently alive.
With little more to gained, Flint struck Klarg with his axe.

The party returned to to the cave to rescue Sildar, but the goblins knew they
were coming and released a trap, a deluge of water broke forth and threatened
to was them all away.  Everyone was able to avoid this except Flint, who was
washed out.  The party regrouped an attacked the 6 goblins who were about to
cook Sildar.  Once the goblin captain and his fellow goblins were slain the
party took Sildar out of the cave and decided to head back to town.
