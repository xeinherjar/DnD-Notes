# Session Notes

## Session 1
Met Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter in Neverwinter, agreed to deliver
their cart of goods to Phandalin for 10gp each.
Each character was granted a healing potion.

On their way they came across an ambush site, where they defeated 4 goblins,
one of which they interrogated.  From the goblin they learned about Klarg the
bugbear, King Grol, and the Black Spider.  They also learned that Gundren
Rockerseeker and his companion, Sildar Hallwinter, are still alive.  Sildar
was taken to Cragmaw Hideout, and Gundren was taken to Cragmaw Castle.

The team headed to the trading post in Plandalin to deliver their cart and to
rest before attempting to rescue anyone.  The owner of the trading post, Elmar
Barthen, paid them their 10gp.  He also rounded up money from some locals as
a reward if they would clear the cave and rescue anyone inside.

They rested at the inn for the night.

### Notes
- Killed 4 goblins
- Found empty map case

## Session 2
Party meets in the dining area of the inn.  After a short discussion they head
out to resupply before heading to Cragmaw Hideout.  From the trading post they
acquire some rope, torches, a bullseye lantern and a grappling hook.

They head back to the scene of the ambush to pick up the trail.  Outside of the
hideout Drupie missed the 2 goblin sentries, however they were quickly felled.

Once inside they found a room that held three wolves, Dilford was able to calm
them with his animal handling.  They then each climbed up the fissure at the
back of the room and found themselves in Klargs room.  Klarg, his wolf and his
2 goblins did not see them.  Sir Bucket was able to sleep the wolf and two
goblins, and more importantly charm Klarg.  They promised to go ambushing with
Klarg, he just needed to meet them outside.  Once Klarg left they were able to
kill off the sleeping enemies.

The party regrouped with Klarg and learned where Sildar was held, and that he
was soon to be eaten.  They also learned the Gundren is still currently alive.
With little more to gained, Flint struck Klarg with his axe.

The party returned to to the cave to rescue Sildar, but the goblins knew they
were coming and released a trap, a deluge of water broke forth and threatened
to wash them all away.  Everyone was able to avoid this except Flint, who was
washed out.  The party regrouped and attacked the 6 goblins who were about to
cook Sildar.  Once the goblin captain and his fellow goblins were slain the
party took Sildar out of the cave and decided to head back to town.

### Notes
- Killed klarg, 1 wolf, 10 goblins
- Charmed den of wolves
- The cave was not fully explored
- Found stolen goods from lionscrest, to be looted or returned
- Loot needs to be divided
    - Three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp
    - 600 cp, 110 sp, two potions of healing
    - Jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp)

# Session 3
Everyone reaches level 2.  The party met downstairs in the Inn.  They split the
treasure evenly.  While they were waiting for `Sildar` to come downstairs they
discussed what to do next.  The only thing they could agree upon was reaching
`Lionscrest Coster` to see if there would be a reward for returning their stolen
goods.

Hood wondered around the inn drinking, Drupie was buying shots and egging him on,
Hood has never said no to a drink.  While drinking he heard a lot of rumors and
stories that he reported to the rest of the party.  They learned of
- `Sister Garaele` who oversees the `Shrine of Luck`, she returned wounded and
exhausted.
- `Daran Edermath`, the keeper of `Edermath Orchard`.  He was a former
adventurer.
- Orc raiders have been spotted on the east end of `Tribor Trail`, townmaster
is looking for someone to run them off.
- `Thel Dendrar`, a woodcarver, stood up to the `Rebrands`, he was murdered in
broad daylight, and now his wife and children.
- `Carp`, `Qelline Alderleaf`'s son found a secret tunnel in the woods.
- The `Redbrands` hassle every business, except `Phanadlin Miner's Exchange`,
they don't want trouble with `Halia Thornton`, who runs it.

`Sildar` came down and asked them to see out `Cragmaw Castle` and find
`Gundren Rockseeker` and his missing map.

The party heads over to `Lionscrest Coster` to speak with `Liene`, they wanted
a reward for finding their stolen goods.  It went poorly.  Dilford opened the
conversation in a way that sounded like they stole it and would return it for
a price.  `Liene` accused them of being thugs, and that she would report them
to the townmaster.  Hood tried to intervene but he was drunk and only made it
worse by threatening to stab her.  The party left, but Flint stayed behind, he
smoothed things over and was promised 25gp for the location if `Sildar` would
vouch that they were not common thugs and were in fact working for him.

The party then set out to meet `Carp` at the `Alderleaf`.  He was excited to
see real life adventurers and wanted to touch all of their weapons.  He was
more than happy to tell them about the secret cave he found and how he narrowly
avoided the `Redbrands` after he found it.  Sir Bucket threw the kid a copper.

On their return trip to `Barthens Provisions` to sell the jade statue and gold
teeth, they ran into some `Rebrands` who stood across the street so they could
not cross.  They spit at them, told them to leave town, and demanded their
stuff.  Comply or death.  Slurs moved across everyone's tongues until the only
recourse left was a fight.  Flint made short work of two of them, while Drupie
killed the third.  The fourth fled after seeing what happened to his
companions. Drupie decided he liked their `studded leather armor`, so he took
one.  He will need to see someone about resizing it to fit his gnome body.  The
towns people cheered when the `Redbrands` were killed, the townmaster,
`Harbin Wester` asked them to stop making trouble and walked away, a look of
concern covered his face and a scow began to form as his turned his head away.

They talked to `Daran Edermath` hoping he would know something about
`Cragmaw Castle`, but like everyone else, he didn't know anything.  He did tell
them about the `Redbrands` headquarters, `Tresendar Manor`.  He also asked them
to look into the ruins of `Old Owl Well`.  The undead have been seen up there
and he is afraid magic might be leaking.

Everyone was tired of running around town, Drupie was tired of hearing about
the `Redbrands` and didn't understand why the townmaster tolerated them.  They
headed over to the townmaster's hall, to confront him.  As they enter the see
the notice of Orcs near `Wyvern Tor` and reward of 100gp to remove them.
The townmaster refused to change his mind about dealing with the `Redbrands`,
he tried to explain that if they failed, it would be his wife and children
who go missing.

`Sildar` enters and can feel the tension in the air.  As a member of the
`Lords' Allience` he supports their efforts to bring law and justice by
removing the `Redbrand` threat.  He offers them 500gp to find `Cragmaw Castle`.
He also mentions a missing member of his order, `Iarno`.  He went missing
around `Tresendar Manor` two months ago, about the time the `Redbrands` showed
up.  The party heads out to the manner.

They entered though the hidden path, there they were confronted by a `gnotic`
who was guarding the crevasse.  They tried to come to an agreement in which
they would bring it bodies of the `Redbrands` they killed in return for leaving
them alone. It failed and a fight broke out, the team was getting the best of
the `gnotic` and before killing it Dilford offered the same agreement again in
return for some information.  The `gnotic` agreed, but had little information
other than one of the bridges was trapped and his agreement to guard the
crevasse was made with a man named `Glasstaff`.

They busted open the next door and found three bugbears and a
goblin they were torturing.  Hood severed the neck of the lead bugbear, Mosk,
and one of the other ones.  Flint knocked the third one out.

### Notes
- Killed three `Redbrands`
- Made a deal with a `gnotic`, dead bodies in return for safe passage
- Killed two bugbears, one was named `Mosk`
- Knocked one bugbear out, to be interrogated

# Session 4
After defeating the bugbears the party noticed a small goblin hiding in the
corner.  Before they could kill it, it introduced itself as `Droop` and offered
information in exchange for its life.  Flint wanted to kill it, but the others
talked him into just tying him up and using him as bait.

From the restrained bugbear they learned that `Glasstaff` was in the buidling and
that he runs the `Redbrands`, but he works for `The Spider`.  With nothing more
to learn Hood executes the bugbear and they search their bodies.  They find some
treasure and a key.

The party returned their attention to `Droop`, with the promise to point out
traps as they go, Flint puts him on a lead rope and they force him to walk in
front and enter all doors first.

In what appears to be a wizards workshop they find that someone was trying to
make invisibility potions, but they had not yet succeeded.  A rat watched them
move across the room, Sir Bucket decided the rat would make a good pet, so he
put him in his pocket.

`Glasstaff's` room was attached, he was nowhere to be found, however they did find
some treasure and a note from `The Spider` addressed to `Lord Albrek`, `Sildar`
will want to know about this.

In the armory the party restocks on arrows and dons the redcloaks hanging on the
wall, as the party continued they entered a small crypt with three sarcophagus,
each in searched.  When the party attempts to enter the next room the skeletons
rise and attack.  They party was able to easily defeat them, however the rat
died as Sir Bucket used it to deflect a hit.

# Session 5
In the cells they free the three captives, in return `Mirna` tells them of her
families heirloom hidden the told old Alchemy shop in `Thundertree`.

With one room left Hood kicks the door down to finish off any remaining
`Redbrands`.  While successful, Flint suffered a critical blow and fell
unconscious.  He was brought back by Dilford.

After leaving the hideout the party had a long discussion about what to do with
`Droop`, it was decided they would set him free over Flint's objections.  In
return `Droop` suggest they locate goblin ambush sites to see if they would know
where `Cragmaw` castle lies.

The party headed back to town to rest and split their treasure.

# Session 6
The party informed `Sildar` of `Lord Albrek`'s betrayal on their way out of
town, he granted the title of `Cloak` to Flint.  They then headed to `Old Owl
Well` to investigate the undead.  There they met `Hamun Kost` and his cadre of undead.
Sir Bucket was able to recognize that he was a Thay necromancer.  He is
unwilling to leave, however if the party can remove the orcs that attack him so
he can research in peace he could wrap up sooner, or if they speak with `Agatha`
the banshee she could tell him who built the tower, and he would leave the area
for now if he knew.

After some debate, Hood wants to kill the necromancer where as Flint wants
nothing to do with a necromancer, everyone heads off to `Conyberry` to speak
with the banshee.  Upon arrival Dilford leads everyone into her house.  After
speaking she considers answering a question for them, but vanishes before they
can ask.  Since they could not gain the answer they head off to `Wyvern Tor` to
handle the orcs.  Drupie tracks down the orcs camp and Sir Bucket transforms
Hood into an orc.  Hood is able to trick the orc standing guard into letting him
close and kills him.  Hood then leads everyone into the cave as 'prisoners' and
they are able to surprise attack the orcs and ogre.

Hood kicks coals into their faces and the party is able to kill them all with
little trouble.  `Brughor Axe-Biter` is knocked out and interrogated, but he had
no useful information.  They party takes a long rest.
