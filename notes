DM: Need to be more descriptic and graphic about the fights, whats happening, 
how are people moving, attacking, standing
describe the smells the tirdness, the hits and misses
if AC is low thye don't have to miss, could bounce of shield or armor maybe 
they move out of the way
describe areas in more detail:
Not sure what this falls under but I keep thinking about more detailed actions
like acrobatics or like maybe we looks around the room and see a chandelier for example
and like enemies on the ground and I take my grappling hook and pull it down on the enemies.
But like I have to roll to see if I do it.
Maybe like more detailed surroundings so we can use the environment .
I know this all puts more pressure on you Alex so I'm ok with what we are doing. We'll only get better

remind them what happened last session
